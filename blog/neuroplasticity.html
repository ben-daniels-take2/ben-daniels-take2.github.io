                        the ability to listen, learn and change for the better, without a growth mindset
                        its hard for someone to grow as a person and see other peoples perspectives and points of view.
                        you limit yourself to what there is to learn.
                        Its also hard to connect with others and to progress forward.
                    </p>
                    <br />

                        Neuroplasticity and how it works, and how i can apply it to my learning journey.
                        I already had a good understanding of a growth mindset. What it is about, the benefits.

                        Will stay and remain open minded, i will do things out of my comfort zone like socializing,
                        asking questions, asking for help, and working with oters
