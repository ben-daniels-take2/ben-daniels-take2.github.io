              I manage my workload by following my study plan. My study plan has
              allocated study and break times. My study and break times all work
              around other commitments that I have during the week. When working
              In a team I will be respectful of others and thier needs.
              Contribute to group discussions and activities. Be open to
              contstructive feedback. Always keep an open mind and be mindful of
              my actions.
