          I was in the exercise yard one day and I witnessed somebody get
          knocked out cold. He fell flat on his face. Everybody in the yard saw
          what happend yet did nothing and carried on like nothing had happened.
          I noticed the person was struggling to breathe. He was lying there
          unconscious face first into the concrete. I thought to myself maybe I
          should carry on and leave him there. Then this chapter in this book I
          had read from Dr Paul Wood came into my head. The chapter was about
          “how violence had become normal to him”. In that moment, I knew this
          was a real chance for me to do something new or different. It hit me
          that violence had become normal to me too. This is not because im a
          violent person rather I’d been In a violent environment for such a
          long while. So I went over and helped this guy by trying to put him
          into the recovery position. Some people started yelling at me to leave
          him and just let him die. I almost listened to them yet I felt this
          strong urge come over me that was to do the right thing. So I did it
          by rolling him over. when that happened he started to breathe and I
          felt a sense of relief come over me. Now I knew I had done something
          right for the first time in a long while. If I had’nt read that book I
          probably would’ve just left him there. This was a significant ethical
          decision that has changed the way I act. I value helping others remain
          safe and well.

          My Maori culture is what keeps me grounded and reminds me of how
          unique I am. My life experiences being Maori have taught me to be
          family orientated, respectful, humble, kind and caring. but also to
          work hard and always be aware of myself, others and my surroundings In
          our culture being respectful means looking after the environment as
          well as looking up to our elders. Our elders have passed down their
          knowledge and language to make us a strong culture. Humility means we
          are modest and dignified in the way in which we behave. I strive to be
          kind and caring in all my interactions with others.

        Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.
      </h6>
      <div class="id-val-2">
        <p>
          My strengths are my determination to achieve at a high level. Im
          always learning to improve myself. My Caring nature allows me to be
          vulnerable which makes it easy for me to connect and relate with
          others who i meet. I have a Positive attitude and open mind that helps
          me push through any obstacles I come across. My Limitations would be
          that I lack the confidence to put myself out there to a big audience.
          I’m a quiet and reserved type of person. Therefore I often struggle to
          ask for help and like to sort out problems on my own. To work on these
          limitations I realise I need to challenge myself to try new things and
          to ask for assistance.
