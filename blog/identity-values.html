        I was in the exercise yard one day and I witnessed somebody get
        knocked out cold. He fell flat on his face. Everybody saw what happend
        yet did nothing and carried on like nothing had happened. I noticed
        the person was struggling to breathe. He was lying there unconscious
        face first into the concrete. I thought to myself maybe I should carry
        on and leave him there. Then this chapter in this book I had read from
        Dr Paul Wood came into my head. The chapter was about “how violence
        had become normal to him”. In that moment, I knew this was a real
        chance for me to do something new or different. It hit me that
        violence had become normal to me too. This is not because im a violent
        person rather I’d been In a violent environment for such a long while.
        So I went over and helped this guy by trying to put him into the
        recovery position. Some people started yelling at me to leave him and
        just let him die. I almost listened to them yet I felt this strong
        urge come over me that was to do the right thing. So I did it by
        rolling him over. when that happened he started to breathe and I felt
        a sense of relief come over me. Now I knew I had done something right
        for the first time in a long while. If I had’nt read that book I
        probably would’ve just left him there. This was a significant ethical
        decision that has changed the way I act. I value helping others remain
        safe and well.

      <p>
        My Maori culture is what keeps me grounded and reminds me of how
        unique I am. My life experiences being Maori have taught me to be
        family orientated, respectful, humble, kind and caring. but also to
        work hard and always be aware of myself, others and my surroundings.
        In our culture being respectful means looking after the environment as
        well as looking up to our elders. Our elders have passed down their
        knowledge and language to make us a strong culture. Humility means we
        are modest and dignified in the way in which we behave. I strive to be
        kind and caring in all my interactions with others.

        ..<u>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations</u>..
      </h4>
      <br />
      <p>
        My strengths are my determination to achieve at a high level. Im
        always learning to improve myself. My Caring nature allows me to be
        vulnerable which makes it easy for me to connect and relate with
        others who i meet. I have a Positive attitude and open mind that helps
        me push through any obstacles I come across. My Limitations would be
        that I lack the confidence to put myself out there to a big audience.
        I’m a quiet and reserved type of person. Therefore I often struggle to
        ask for help and like to sort out problems on my own. To work on these
        limitations I realise I need to challenge myself to try new things and
        to ask for assistance.

        I was given a fitness coaching role for a rugby league team. So I
        created a fitness, strength and conditioning plan. Anyone of any size
        or fitness level could do. Fitness is important when you’re out on the
        field. I told the team they had to meet a “fitness requirement level”
        before they could play. Most of the team were happy, but others were
        not. They thought being big and strong is enough. So when the team had
        their first game, they got smashed because half the team werent fit
        enough.

      <h4>
        ..<u>Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they
          were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try
          now, and why</u>..
      </h4>

      <br />

      <p>
        after that first game a stratergy i used was. before training started
        we would open up with a karakia (prayer) to lighten the mood. Team
        bonding exercises and Team encouragement. getting the whole team to
        encourage one another. starting strong together and finishing strong
        together. Reminding players there were only limited spots and they had
        to earn thier place. Having those stratergies in place really helped
        the team to bond / gel and come together. training become enjoyable
        and fun.
