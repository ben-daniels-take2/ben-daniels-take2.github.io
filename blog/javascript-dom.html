        <p>HTML: if you were to build a house you would use HTML.</p>
        <p>
          CSS: now when youre ready to design your house for eg: interior
          design. Thats when when you would CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML like a “Hammer” a building tool. CSS is like a “paintbrush” a
          design tool.

          The control flow is the order that a computer runs the code within a
          script. It flows down to the first line to the last line. unless it
          comes across conditionals or loops which change the control flow.
          Loops are used when you want something to be repeated, when you create
          a loop its important to include a code that tells the loop when to
          stop. Say you needed to hit something a certain amount of times to win
          a prize. a loop would cause you to keep repeating this, until
          something ended the loop. like when you win the prize and have hit the
          item a certain amount of times. you would program the loop to restart.

          The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming
          interface (API). Its like a master key of web design. The dom can be
          used to manupilate a web pages design in any way you like.

        <br />
        <p>
          Functions are code that perform a specific job. Functions take in info
          (arguements), process it, and "return" a result. a function can be
          used (called) over and over and over again to perform the task that is
          assigned to it.

        <h4>
          ..<u
            >Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and
            objects</u
          >..
        </h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          Arrays store data in an ordered collection in which the data can be
          accessed using a numerical index.
        </p>
        <p>
          Objects are used to represent a ‘Thing’. anything like cars, plants,
          person, anything
        </p>
        <p>
          When to use array and when to use object? It is pretty simple if you
          have to store the data in order or in a sequence then use array
          otherwise you can use object for everything else.
