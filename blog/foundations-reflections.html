                    They play a key part to you being able to learn, listen, connect and communicate effectively.
                    theres no way you can form and build long lasting meaningful relationships without learning about
                    any of these
                    roles.

                <p>Being able to reflect on a deeper level and express myself as if im talking to a real person in front
                    of me. The amount of work and effort Dev Academy have put into core. All the learnings i took away
                    from core material. Seeing how everything i learned you can apply in everyday life.

                        <u>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</u>

                    <p>
                        Having to find someone to pair up with for the listening and looping execises. Im shy and lack
                        the confidence to put myself out there. But i did in the end to challenge myself. Other than
                        that core learning was good for me and i didnt find anything to challenging.

                    <h4>
                        <u>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core
                            learning in a web development bootcamp course?.</u>

                    <p>
                        Learning core skills are important to have and maintain. Especially when working with others.
                        Being able to communicate and connect with others makes it alot easier to collaborate and
                        problem solve when coding and programming. You could be the best programmer in the world but
                        stil be the shittiest person ever if you dont know how to connect with others. You cant
                        programme human skills but you can learn them.

                    <h4>
                        <u>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you
                            have just used that time to practise programming instead?</u>

                    <p>
                        no. having both tech and core was a good balance for me. I enjoyed being able to reflect after
                        each sprint. At first my reflecting was surface level but as the weeks went on i started to
                        reflect more in depth. I liked being able to sharpen back up on human skills through core
                        learning
