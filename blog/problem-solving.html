                    I got stuck on the fizzbuzz challenge. Fizzbuzz is a challenge that requires certain numbers to
                    return a certain “string” (word). To figure out what to do i googled what it was about and found
                    some ideas about how to approach this challenge. Checked out the foundations channel and found some
                    ideas there too. Then i realised id been thinking to hard into this challenge and the solution was,
                    well not simple but do-able. Through out the challenge i found my anxiety levels start to come down.
                    There was also a solution file which really helped me understand what i was looking at. Having a
                    solution file there made the fizzbuzz challenge alot better for me. What i learnt from this problem
                    was: not to overthink things.

                        I feel my reflections are starting to improve. I am starting to share more and be more in depth
                        when reflecting on my foundations journey.
